  There is no right software language to get started with software development. From a fundamental point of view, all software languages ​​work with the same logic. The difference between software languages ​​is syntax differences. Before starting to learn software development, you should learn what is Algorithm and Algorithmic thinking. 
  After understanding the logic of the algorithm, which software language it doesn't matter what you learn. The important part here is that after starting to learn a software language, you should non stop. I would also like to add that, software development cannot be learned from any video or book.
  You can learn only programming language syntax from videos or books, and this is not enough. When you come to the application part, you will encounter a big problem. 
Long story short, the only way to learn software is to make projects. This project word don't be intimidated you. The program that basic calculator is a project but it using image processing for defines your hand movements program is also a project. Of course, the project I'm talking about is beginner level projects will be. 
  For this reason, our roadmap will first understand the logic of the algorithm and then learn a software language syntax, after learning you will make your own project.

Which Software Language for Starting

It doesn't really matter which programming language you learn to get started. I recommend starting with Python as its syntax is simple. That's why here is Python related resources.
